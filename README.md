# PYTHON_CODESAMPLE
Overview
This Python program demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming, file input/output, and exception handling. It defines two classes, Book and Library. Book is a simple class that represents a book, with attributes for title, author, genre, and year. Library is a more complex class that represents a collection of books. It has methods for adding and removing books from the collection, listing all the books in the collection, and saving/loading the collection to/from a file.
Usage
To use this program, create a file called books.txt in the same directory as the Python script. Each line in the file should contain information about a single book in the following format:
Title|Author|Genre|Year
To run the program, simply execute the Python script. It will load the collection of books from the books.txt file, print a list of all the books to the console, and then save the collection back to the file.
